# Implementation of Residual Attention Network for Image Classification Paper
- Here's my attempt on implementing the paper, **Residual Attention Network for Image Classification Paper** by (Fei Wang et.al) [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06904)
- Though, I've written an implementation for this architecture, I can't seem produce a satisfactory results.
- This implementation is likely flawed and I'll move on other papers to implement
- I might return to this paper when I have time again.
