# Machine Learning Paper Implementation
This is my personal repository of the Machine Learning Papers I've implemented. 

## Constraints in Implementing Papers

These are the constraints I imposed to myself when implementing these papers.

- Make checking sample codes minimal.
- Reusing small parts (i.e. Convolution Layer, Color Jittering) from Machine Learning frameworks is okay.
- Focus on the concepts, and principles that the papers has discussed, and translate those concepts and principles into a working code.


## Papers to Implement (Done/TODO)
